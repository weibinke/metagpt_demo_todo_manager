## Original Requirements
The boss requires a web page for managing a todo list, which includes registration and login functionality.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a user-friendly web page for managing todo lists",
    "Incorporate user registration and login functionality",
    "Ensure the product is efficient and reliable"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to register an account so that I can have my personal todo list",
    "As a user, I want to login to my account to access my todo list",
    "As a user, I want to add tasks to my todo list so that I can keep track of them",
    "As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed once I finish them",
    "As a user, I want to delete tasks from my todo list once they are no longer relevant"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Todoist: A popular todo list app with a clean interface and robust features",
    "Microsoft To Do: Integrated with Microsoft's suite of products, offering seamless sync across devices",
    "Google Tasks: Simple and straightforward, but lacks some advanced features",
    "Any.do: Features a daily planner and assistant, but the interface can be confusing",
    "Trello: More of a project management tool, but can be used for personal todo lists",
    "Asana: Designed for team collaboration, might be overkill for personal use",
    "Wunderlist: Was a popular choice, but has been discontinued and replaced by Microsoft To Do"
]
```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a web page that allows users to manage their todo lists. It should include functionality for user registration and login. Users should be able to add, complete, and delete tasks from their todo lists.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("User registration and login functionality", "P0"),
    ("Ability to add tasks to the todo list", "P0"),
    ("Ability to mark tasks as completed", "P0"),
    ("Ability to delete tasks from the todo list", "P0"),
    ("Ensure the product is efficient and reliable", "P0")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The web page should have a clean and minimalist design, with a focus on usability. The main element should be the todo list, where tasks are displayed in a list format. Each task should have a checkbox for marking it as completed, and a delete button for removing it from the list. At the top of the page, there should be a form for adding new tasks to the list. There should also be a navigation bar with options for registering and logging in.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
