## Logic Analysis

    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application, initializes the Flask application, and contains the routes for user registration, login, logout, and task management."),
    ("models.py", "Contains the User and Task classes, which are the data models for the application. The User class has methods for creating a new user and checking a user's password. The Task class has methods for creating a new task, marking a task as completed, and deleting a task."),
    ("forms.py", "Contains the forms for user registration, login, and task creation."),
    ("templates/index.html", "The main page of the application, displays the list of tasks."),
    ("templates/login.html", "The login page."),
    ("templates/register.html", "The registration page."),
    ("templates/base.html", "The base template that other templates extend."),
    ("static/css/main.css", "The CSS file for the application.")

## Task list

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'main.py' file is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the Flask application and contains the routes for user registration, login, logout, and task management.

The 'models.py' file contains the User and Task classes, which are the data models for the application. The User class has methods for creating a new user and checking a user's password. The Task class has methods for creating a new task, marking a task as completed, and deleting a task.

The 'forms.py' file contains the forms for user registration, login, and task creation.

The 'templates' directory contains the HTML templates for the application. The 'index.html' file is the main page of the application, which displays the list of tasks. The 'login.html' and 'register.html' files are the login and registration pages, respectively. The 'base.html' file is the base template that other templates extend.

The 'static/css/main.css' file is the CSS file for the application.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There is no unclear part in the provided information. The main entry point of the application is 'main.py'. All third-party libraries are initialized in this file. The application uses Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, and Flask-WTF, which are all well-documented and widely used libraries.
